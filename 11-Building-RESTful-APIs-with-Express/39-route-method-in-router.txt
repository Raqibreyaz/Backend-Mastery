Used to chain multiple HTTP methods (like GET, POST, etc.) for the same route in a cleaner way.

Example:
app.route("/user")
  .get(getUser)
  .post(createUser)
  .put(updateUser);

Keeps your code organized and readable.
Functionally same as using app.get(), app.post() separately.
Use it when methods share the same path.
