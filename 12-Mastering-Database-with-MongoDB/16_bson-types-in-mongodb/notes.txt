Key takeaway:
- you can query/fetch based on the data types of the BSON data
- example -
db.users.find({property: {$type: "string"}})    // DATA TYPES ARE CASE SENSITIVE
or based on their numeric code as well using.
db.users.find({property: {$type: 2}})        // here 2 points to "string" (refer to mongodb bson reference docs)
