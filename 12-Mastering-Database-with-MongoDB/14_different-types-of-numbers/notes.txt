MongoDB Number Data Types

    Int32 (Standard Number)

        -> Used for regular integers.
        -> Suitable for most everyday use cases.
        -> Range is from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.

    Int64 – NumberLong()

        -> Used for very large integers that exceed the Int32 range.
        -> Required when numbers go beyond JavaScript's safe integer limit.

    Decimal128 – NumberDecimal()

        -> Used for high-precision decimal values.
        -> Ideal for financial or scientific data where rounding errors must be avoided.
