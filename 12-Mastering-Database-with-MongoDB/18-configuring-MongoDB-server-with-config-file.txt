MongoDB Config File 

    -> It’s a text file where you tell MongoDB how to run.

    -> You can set things like:
        -> Where to save your data (dbPath).
        -> Where to save logs.
        -> What network address and port to use.

    Example to set data folder:
        storage:
        dbPath: C:\my_mongo_data

    -> To start MongoDB using this file, run:
        mongod --config path\to\mongod.config
