Read Operation in MongoDB

    -> db represent to the current database used.
    -> we can do db.<collectionName>.find()
        It will show all the available documents in it.
        It returns a cursor, it is like an array
    
    -> For finding specific documents we can pass an object in find()
        db.<collectionName>.find({ user: "23" })

    -> Just like find we also have findOne method,
        Which returns only the first match (as Object not cursor).
        db.<collectionName>.findOne({ user: "23" })

    -> If we want to find document in more depth, use configuration object:
        db.<collectionName>.findOne({ user: {$gt : 2} })

        $gt -> greaterThan
        $gte -> greaterThanEqualTo
        $lt -> LessThan
        $lte -> LessThanEqualTo
