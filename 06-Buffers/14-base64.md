## BASE_64 & BASE_64_URL

- it has only 64 charaters
- it has it's own table of character encoding, like 'A': 0 and '/': 63
- base-64 string's size will be 4/3 times of the original
- base-64 string of image can directly be given as source in image tag through 'data url' syntax + same applies for all files like js, css, video etc
- also a 'data url' of base-64 of any data can be directly used as a url in browser
- base-64-url do the base-64 encoding + sanitizes the string for url purpose, like '/' is replaced by '_' and '+' is replaced by '-' and '=' is removed

```
a        b        c
01100001 01100010 01100011
```

make 6-bit groups:

```
  011000 010110 001001 100011
  24     22     9      35
  Y      W      J      j
```

### Rules

1. At least 3 bytes should be there to work with
2. means 0n splitting to 6-bit groups it should be 24 bits
3. if 3 bytes are not there then base-64 encoding will add multiple 0s to fill the remaining bits.
4. when a byte is created by 0s to make 3-byte, a placeholder byte of 0s then '=' will be used for it instead of 'A'

### In Browser

**1. btoa(string)**: converts textual data to base-64  
**1. atob(string)**: converts base-64 data to actual text

### Examples

```
char: 'a'
encoding: 97
binary: 01100001
6-bit groups: 011000 010000 000000 000000
base-64: 'YQ=='
```

```
text: abcd
encoding: 97 98 99 100
binary: 01100001 01100010 01100011 01100100
6-bit groups: 011000 010110 001001 100011 011001 000000 000000 000000
                24   22     9      35     25     0      0      0
base-64: 'YWJjZA==', because 2 bits from data were added in 0s as 0 => 'A'
```
